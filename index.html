         <h3>"The Father of Modern Computer Science, The creator of Bombe, The Enigma Killer..."</h3>
         <h3>School</h3>
                <p>Turing's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a day school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-Sea, at the age of six.
                The headmistress recognised his talent early on, as did many of his subsequent teachers.

                Between January 1922 and 1926, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the
                village of Frant in Sussex (now East Sussex).In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to Sherborne School, a boarding
                independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General
                Strike in Britain, but he was so determined to attend, that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles (97 km) from
                Southampton to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.                Turing c. 1928 at age 16

                Turing's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at
                Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents: "I
                hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming educated. If he is
                to be solely a Scientific Specialist, he is wasting his time at a public school".Despite this, Turing continued to
                show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even
                elementary calculus. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not only did he grasp it, but it is
                possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of motion from a text in which this was never
                made explicit.</p> 

         <h3>University and work on computability</h3>
               <p>After Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, Cambridge,here he was
               awarded first-class honours in mathematics. In 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a fellow of King's on the strength
               of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.Unknown to the committee, the theorem had already
               been proven, in 1922, by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg.A blue plaque at the college was unveiled on the centenary of his
               birth on 23 June 2012 and is now installed at the college's Keynes Building on King's Parade.               
               In 1936, Turing published his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem".It was
               published in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society journal in two parts, the first on 30 November and the
               second on 23 December.In this paper, Turing reformulated Kurt GÃ¶del's 1931 results on the limits of proof and
               computation, replacing GÃ¶del's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical
               devices that became known as Turing machines. The Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) was originally posed by German
               mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his "universal computing machine" would be capable of performing
               any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no
               solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable: it is not
               possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt.
               King's College, Cambridge, where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named
               after him.
               
               Although Turing's proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church's equivalent proof using his lambda calculus,               Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church's.It also included a notion of a
               'Universal Machine' (now known as a universal Turing machine), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks
               of any other computation machine (as indeed could Church's lambda calculus). According to the Churchâ€“Turing thesis,
               Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. John von Neumann
               acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper.To this day, Turing machines
               are a central object of study in theory of computation.
               
               From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University,n the
               second year as a Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology
               and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.In June 1938, he obtained his PhD
               from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton;his dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals,               introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of relative computing, where Turing machines are augmented with
               so-called oracles, allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines. John von Neumann wanted to
               hire him as his postdoctoral assistant, but he went back to the United Kingdom./p>

         <h3>Cryptanalysis</h3>
               <p>During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The
               historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said, "You needed exceptional talent, you needed genius at Bletchley
               and Turing's was that genius."               
               From September 1938, Turing had been working part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), the British
               codebreaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma with Dilly Knox, a senior GC&CS
               codebreaker.Soon after the July 1939 Warsaw meeting at which the Polish Cipher Bureau had provided the British and
               French with the details of the wiring of Enigma rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma code messages, Turing and
               Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem.The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator
               procedure that the Germans were likely to change, which they did in May 1940. Turing's approach was more general, using
               crib-based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe (an improvement of the Polish
               Bomba).               Two cottages in the stable yard at Bletchley Park. Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940, before moving to Hut 8.
               
               On 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime
               station of GC&CS.Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during
               the war. The others were: deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy; developing a statistical procedure
               for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed Banburismus; developing a procedure for working out the cam
               settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40/42 (Tunny) dubbed Turingery and, towards the end of the war, the development
               of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah.
               
               By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process, Turing
               made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches, titled The
               Applications of Probability to Cryptographyand Paper on Statistics of Repetitions,which were of such value to
               GC&CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012, shortly before
               the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician, "who identified himself only as Richard," said at the time that the
               fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance, and their relevance to
               post-war cryptanalysis:               
               said the fact that the contents had been restricted "shows what a tremendous importance it has in the foundations
               of our subject". ... The papers detailed using "mathematical analysis to try and determine which are the more likely
               settings so that they can be tried as quickly as possible." ... Richard said that GCHQ had now "squeezed the juice" out
               of the two papers and was "happy for them to be released into the public domain".
               
               Turing had a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as "Prof" and his treatise on
               Enigma was known as the "Prof's Book".According to historian Ronald Lewin, Jack Good, a cryptanalyst who worked
               with Turing, said of his colleague:
               
               In the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever, and he would cycle to the office wearing a
               service gas mask to keep the pollen off. His bicycle had a fault: the chain would come off at regular intervals. Instead
               of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to
               adjust the chain by hand. Another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it
               being stolen.               
               Peter Hilton recounted his experience working with Turing in Hut 8 in his "Reminiscences of Bletchley Park" from A
               Century of Mathematics in America:               
               It is a rare experience to meet an authentic genius. Those of us privileged to inhabit the world of scholarship are
               familiar with the intellectual stimulation furnished by talented colleagues. We can admire the ideas they share with us
               and are usually able to understand their source; we may even often believe that we ourselves could have created such
               concepts and originated such thoughts. However, the experience of sharing the intellectual life of a genius is entirely
               different; one realizes that one is in the presence of an intelligence, a sensibility of such profundity and originality
               that one is filled with wonder and excitement.
               
               Alan Turing was such a genius, and those, like myself, who had the astonishing and unexpected opportunity, created by
               the strange exigencies of the Second World War, to be able to count Turing as colleague and friend will never forget
               that experience, nor can we ever lose its immense benefit to us.
               
               Hilton echoed similar thoughts in the Nova PBS documentary Decoding Nazi Secrets.               
               While working at Bletchley, Turing, who was a talented long-distance runner, occasionally ran the 40 miles (64 km) to
               London when he was needed for meetings,and he was capable of world-class marathon standards.Turing tried
               out for the 1948 British Olympic team but he was hampered by an injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11
               minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards' Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. He was Walton
               Athletic Club's best runner, a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone.               
               In 1946, Turing was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by King George VI for his wartime
               services, but his work remained secret for many years.</p>

         <h3>Bombe</h3>
               <p>Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park,Turing had specified an electromechanical machine called the bombe,
               which could break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba kryptologiczna, from which its name was derived. The
               bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman, became one of the primary tools, and the major
               automated one, used to attack Enigma-enciphered messages.               A complete and working replica of a bombe now at The National Museum of Computing on Bletchley Park
               
               The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message (i.e., rotor order, rotor settings and
               plugboard settings) using a suitable crib: a fragment of probable plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors
               (which had on the order of 1019 states, or 1022 states for the four-rotor U-boat variant),the bombe performed a
               chain of logical deductions based on the crib, implemented electromechanically.tion needed]
               
               The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting, moving on to the next. Most of the
               possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A
               contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter, which was
               impossible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940.               
               By late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman, Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner-Barry were
               frustrated. Building on the work of the Poles, they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals, but
               their limited staff and bombes meant they could not translate all the signals. In the summer, they had considerable
               success, and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month; however, they badly needed more resources to keep
               abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels, but
               had failed.               
               On 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill explaining their difficulties, with Turing as the first named.
               They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared
               with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces.As Andrew Hodges, biographer of Turing, later wrote,
               "This letter had an electric effect."Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay, which read: "ACTION THIS DAY. Make
               sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done." On 18 November, the chief of
               the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken.The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did
               not know of the Prime Minister's response, but as Milner-Barry recalled, "All that we did notice was that almost from
               that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth."More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the
               end of the war</p>

         <h3>Hut 8 and the naval Enigma</h3>
               <p>Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma "because no one else was doing
               anything about it and I could have it to myself".In December 1939, Turing solved the essential part of the naval
               indicator system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services.               
               That same night, he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus, a sequential statistical technique (what Abraham Wald
               later called sequential analysis) to assist in breaking the naval Enigma, "though I was not sure that it would work in
               practice, and was not, in fact, sure until some days had actually broken."For this, he invented a measure of weight
               of evidence that he called the ban. Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors, substantially
               reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes.Later this sequential process of accumulating sufficient
               weight of evidence using decibans (one tenth of a ban) was used in Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher               
               Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and
               bombe construction in Washington; he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio.
               
               Turing's reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic:
               
               The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the
               conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme, but thought that no particular purpose would be served by
               pointing out that we would not really use them in that way.
               
               Their test (of commutators) can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic
               stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do
               something about it.               
               During this trip, he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices.He returned to
               Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence, Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8,
               although Alexander had been de facto head for some time (Turing having little interest in the day-to-day running of the
               section). Turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.               
               Alexander wrote of Turing's contribution:
               
               There should be no question in anyone's mind that Turing's work was the biggest factor in Hut 8's success. In the early
               days, he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for
               the main theoretical work within the Hut, but he also shared with Welchman and Keen the chief credit for the invention
               of the bombe. It is always difficult to say that anyone is 'absolutely indispensable', but if anyone was indispensable
               to Hut 8, it was Turing. The pioneer's work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make
               everything seem easy and many of us in Hut 8 felt that the magnitude of Turing's contribution was never fully realised
               by the outside world.</p>
